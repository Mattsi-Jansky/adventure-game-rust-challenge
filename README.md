# Adventure Game Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for Rust. Your challenge is: Make something cool. `adventure_game_challenge` is a bare-bones adventure game. You can type things like `look` to look around, `pickup` to pick up items in the area, or `help` to see a full list of commands.

## Challenges

Implement anything that you think is cool. Here are a few ideas to get you started, ordered roughly by difficulty:

* Add a new Item
* Refactor how commands are processed following Command Pattern
* Add other Areas that can be moved to with directional commands like `north`, `south`, `east`
* Add Enemies and Combat
